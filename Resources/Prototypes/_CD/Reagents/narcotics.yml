# Organic


# Mindleaf / Raw form
# Cannot be metabolizes, can be ground into Breakout, which can be processed into Rust and Bake using other chemicals

# Stray / Tea form
# Tea bag can be crafted by hand, add to water 1-1 to create a soothing tea
# Makes you feel at ease, numbs minor pain and keeps you awake. Metabolizes slowly
# Relatively safe, no OD limit and has minor addiction risk, 40u?

# Breakout / Coarse Powder form
# Direct process from grinding Mindleaf, can be crafted into more potent drugs
# Extremely dangerous form, better off used to create Rust and Bake
# 15u OD, causes jittering and seizures, causes caustic damage to kidneys and liver above 5u, 
# User feels invincable while high, metabolizes into Polytrinic Acid at high doses
# Worst addiction risk of all Mindleaf types

# Refined Organic

# Rust / Smokable form
# Made from Breakout, Tranexamic Acid and Hydroxide at high temperature
# Highly dangerous, metabolizes rapidly into Histamine at high doses
# Blocks most pain, makes the user feel highly motivated 
# OD causes mass expulsion of stomach contents
# Second worse addiction risk of all Mindleaf types

# Bake / Fine Powder form
# Further refined from Rust using Ultravasculine and Diphenylmethylamine with a catalyst of Sigynate
# Decently safe OD risk, addiction occurs first. High doses attacks the lungs and kidneys directly.
# User moves slightly faster, acts as surgical anesthetic, 
# !!!EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO SELL!!!

# Grit / Injector fluid form
# 'Amps you up' makes you aggressive, dulls pain. Makes you feel 'REALLY FUCKIN' GOOD MAN!!'
# Adrenaline, Speed, jitters, chance to vomit, poison damage
# Do not mix with other forms of Mindleaf, causes Grit to metabolize into Lexorin and metabolizes blood
# Combine with Bake and Desoxyephedrine with Psicodine as a catalyst
