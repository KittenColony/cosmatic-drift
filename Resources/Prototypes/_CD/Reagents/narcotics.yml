# Breakout / Coarse Powder form

# 15u OD, causes jittering and seizures, causes caustic damage to kidneys and liver above 5u, 
# User feels invincable while high, metabolizes into Polytrinic Acid at high doses
# Worst addiction risk of all Mindleaf types

# Refined Organic

# Rust / Smokable form
# Made from Breakout, Tranexamic Acid and Hydroxide at high temperature
# Highly dangerous, metabolizes rapidly into Histamine at high doses
# Blocks most pain, makes the user feel highly motivated 
# OD causes mass expulsion of stomach contents
# Second worse addiction risk of all Mindleaf types

# Bake / Fine Powder form
# Further refined from Rust using Ultravasculine and Diphenylmethylamine with a catalyst of Sigynate
# Decently safe OD risk, addiction occurs first. High doses attacks the lungs and kidneys directly.
# User moves slightly faster, acts as surgical anesthetic, 
# !!!EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO SELL!!!

# Grit / Injector fluid form
# 'Amps you up' makes you aggressive, dulls pain. Makes you feel 'REALLY FUCKIN' GOOD MAN!!'
# Adrenaline, Speed, jitters, chance to vomit, poison damage
# Do not mix with other forms of Mindleaf, causes Grit to metabolize into Lexorin and metabolizes blood
# Combine with Bake and Desoxyephedrine with Psicodine as a catalyst
